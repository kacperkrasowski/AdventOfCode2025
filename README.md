# AdventOfCode2025
Some of my solutions to the Advent of Code
# MAY CONTAIN SPOLERS

## Day 1
It was more difficult than I expected, also I feel very rusted as I have not done anything code oriented in some time

## Day 2
A bit more difficult, but i was more methodological, thus no issues

## Day 3
Am becoming less rusty. This day was defo the most fun one so far.

## Day 4
Meh

## Day 5
Super fun one, but made me think. 

## Day 6
Easier than day 5, in general, half way through i would expect something more difficult

## Day 7
Made me bleed a bit. Recursive functions and sufficient stats are satysfying

## Day 8 
i wasted at least 3 hours trying to implement the stuff using the laplacian AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
